name: brain-apply
description: Apply the user's decisions on proposed changes to the brain. Shows pending proposals in chat and applies what the user approves, rejects or fixes, or reads the calls and What to fix texts the user left in the Notion Review queue and applies them, then rebuilds and republishes. Use when the user says "apply my reviews", "what needs my decision", "approve the launch change", "apply the Review queue", or after deciding proposals in Notion.

# Apply review decisions

Proposals are changes the brain wants to make to existing notes (decision 0003). The user decides each one: **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Fix** (apply it, corrected as the user says in plain words; decision 0045). This skill records those decisions and applies them through the CLI. Only the user decides. Never approve, reject or fix on their behalf, and never infer a decision from the minutes or from earlier chat.

Run every CLI command as `brain <command> --brain <brain> --json`. Exit 1 means some items need attention; read them. Exit 2 or 4 means your command or input was wrong: fix it. Exit 3 or 5 means stop and report. Exit 10: report a bug. If `brain` is not found (`command not found`), install it with `npm install -g ultimate-brain`, then retry.

## Pick the mode

- **Chat:** the user wants to decide here ("what needs my decision?", "approve the budget change"). Use this, or when Notion is not configured.
- **Notion:** the user decided in the Notion Review queue ("apply my reviews"), and `brain status` shows `review` among `notion.configured`.
- **Unattended** (a scheduled or background run, nobody in the chat): Notion mode with `--record-only`. Decisions are recorded but **never applied** (0003); the next attended run applies them.

## Chat mode

1. **List.** Run `brain proposal list --status pending,approved,edited,rejected`. `approved`, `edited` and `rejected` ones were decided earlier but not yet applied.
2. **Show** the pending ones as a numbered list, one line each, in words the user can judge without opening files:
   `3. Acme website: budget 80000 EUR → 95000 EUR. "Budget raised to 95000 EUR to cover the CMS licence." (Acme launch review, 10 Dec)`
   For each kind:
   - `update_fact`: old → new value.
   - `contradiction`: both values, and say approving keeps both as contested, while a fix picks the true one.
   - `add_to_note`: the text to add.
   - `update_body` (decision 0045): the reference note and the lines that change, `-` old and `+` new.
   - `add_link`: what gets linked to what. A grouped row lists every link, lettered: "Acme website: add a) Lucía Fernández, b) Tomás Vidal to People, c) alias 'acme site'".
   - `supersede`: the new note replaces the old one.
   - `merge`: the duplicate is folded into the survivor.
   - `new_item`: the note that would be created.
   - `review_notes` (decisions 0041, 0043, 0045): everything one input proposes, lettered as the Review row's Proposed letters them: the **changes** first (every fact change marked ⚠, a new fact as `(new) → <value>`; then new text for a reference; then text added to a note), then the new **notes**, then the **links**. "From Acme launch review: a) ⚠ Launch date on Acme website: 2027-02 → 2027-03, b) Add to Row-level security: Carlos will use RLS…, c) Decision: Use Contentful as the blog CMS, …, h) People on Acme website: Lucía Fernández". End the line with the source and date ("(Acme sync, 3 Dec)"), with no quote: each item has its own `why`, shown when the user asks. Approving applies the changes, makes the notes `reviewed` and applies the links; rejecting archives the notes still `draft` and applies nothing.
   - `answer`: the question and its answer, and the note that answers it: "Who owns the mobile app? → Carlos Ruiz owns it (decision: Carlos owns the mobile app)". Approving closes the question; it shows as Answered in Notion.

   Look up titles with `brain index --json` instead of showing ids. Mention the ones already decided but not applied.
3. **Ask** which to approve, reject or fix. Accept replies like "approve 1 and 3, reject 2, fix 4: 90000 EUR", "approve 5 except b" or "fix 5: a is March, c belongs to Acme app". Fix works on every kind: read the user's words into `fixes` as "Reading What to fix" below says. On a grouped `add_link` or a `review_notes`, "except b" leaves those items out: on a `review_notes` they move to a new pending row (deferred, not rejected). When a reply names a row by its source and two rows share it, the letter or title only one of them has settles it; otherwise ask. **If a reply is unclear, ask again.** Don't guess.
4. **Apply.** Write the input and run `brain apply --input <file>`:
   ```json
   { "decisions": [
     { "proposal": "prp-…", "action": "approve", "decided_at": "<now, ISO 8601 UTC>", "decided_by": "chat" },
     { "proposal": "prp-…", "action": "fix", "note": "90000 EUR", "fixes": [ { "value": "90000 EUR" } ], "decided_at": "<now>", "decided_by": "chat" },
     { "proposal": "prp-…", "action": "approve", "exclude": [ { "field": "people", "value": "per-…" } ], "decided_at": "<now>", "decided_by": "chat" },
     { "proposal": "prp-…", "action": "approve", "note": "all except a, h", "exclude": [ { "change": 0 }, { "target": "per-…", "field": "aliases", "value": "Mari López" } ], "decided_at": "<now>", "decided_by": "chat" },
     { "proposal": "prp-…", "action": "fix", "note": "a is March", "fixes": [ { "change": 0, "value": "2027-03" } ], "decided_at": "<now>", "decided_by": "chat" }
   ] }
   ```
   To apply only what was decided earlier, run `brain apply` with no `--input`.
5. Continue with **Finish** below.

## Notion mode

1. **Read** the Review database through the Notion MCP: the rows where **Your call** is set and **State** is Pending. Normalize each row into the snapshot format of spec/cli.md §5.14.1:
   - `database: "review"`, the `page_id` and `last_edited`;
   - the properties Name, Kind, Your call, What to fix, State and Brain ID. A space not yet migrated (migration 0009) still has Decision and Note: send them under those names, and the CLI reads them the same way, Edit as Fix.
2. **Plan.** Run `brain sync plan --input <snapshot>`. It writes nothing. Save the reply's **`data` object** (not the whole JSON reply) as the plan file; `sync apply` rejects the full reply. Read:
   - `decisions`: what will be applied;
   - `conflicts`: `NOTE_TO_READ` is an Approve or Reject with text in What to fix, and `FIX_TO_READ` a Fix with its text: read each as "Reading What to fix" below says. `FIX_WITHOUT_TEXT` is a Fix with What to fix empty: the user says what's wrong in Notion (or here);
   - `ignored`: e.g. `ALREADY_TERMINAL`. Nothing to do.
3. **Apply.** Run `brain sync apply --input <plan file>`, adding `--record-only` when unattended. Then apply the decisions you resolved from What to fix with `brain apply --input <file>` (unattended: leave `NOTE_TO_READ` and `FIX_TO_READ` rows for an attended run).
4. Continue with **Finish** below.

## Reading What to fix

What to fix is the user's instruction for that one row, in plain words (decisions 0037, 0045). The CLI never interprets it; you do, and you **never apply a change the text doesn't clearly ask for**. Read the letters against the proposal itself (`brain proposal list --target <a note id>`, then its `changes`, `notes` and `links`), never against what you remember of the row. Letters run over the items in the order of spec/schema.md §11.3: every entry of `changes` (as stored), then `notes`, then `links`; `a` is `{ "change": 0 }` when the row has changes. A letter the row doesn't have → ask. A title works like a letter ("all except the risk"). Every decision you write carries `note` = the text as written, `decided_at` = the row's `last_edited`, `decided_by: notion` (in chat: now and `chat`).

- **Approve with a narrower scope** ("all except b, e", "only Ana"): `approve` with one `exclude` entry per item left out: `{ "change": <index> }`, `{ "note": "<id>" }` or `{ "target", "field", "value" }` on a Review notes row, `{ "field", "value" }` from `links` on an `add_link` row. On a Review notes row the excluded items move to a new pending row; say so in the report.
- **Fix** (Your call is Fix, or an Approve whose text corrects a value: "yes, but it's March"): `fix` with `fixes`, by kind (spec/schema.md §11.3):
  - a fact, a contradiction, text to add, a reference's new text or an answer: one `{ "value": … }`, the corrected value or text. For a fact, write the value in the shape the fact has (`2027-03`, not "March");
  - a supersede or merge: one `{ "value": "<id>" }`, the note it should be instead;
  - a possible new note: `{ "field": "title" | <a frontmatter key>, "value": … }`;
  - an add_link row: `{ "link": { "field", "value" }, "value": <the corrected value> }`;
  - a Review notes row: `{ "change": <index>, "value": … }` for a change ("a: March"), `{ "note": "<id>", "field", "value" }` for a new note ("c belongs to Acme app" → `field: projects`, `value: ["prj-…"]`; a title, summary or area works the same way), `{ "link": { "target", "field", "value" }, "value": … }` for a link ("Lucía is on Acme website, not Acme app").

  A fix and an "except" can come together ("all except b, and a is March"): `fix` with both `fixes` and `exclude`, never on the same item. Names become ids through `brain index --json`; a name that matches no note, or two → ask.
- **Reject with a reason** ("wrong meeting"): `reject`; the reason is kept in `note`.
- **A different change** (a role typed on a link row, a fact about another note) → apply this row as Your call says, and write the other change as its own proposal with `brain proposal new` (`why` = the text, `source` = the proposal's `source`), so it gets its own Review row.
- **Unclear** → ask the user, quoting the text, and leave the row as it is until they answer.

In a catch-up these are decided in its read-only pass and confirmed in its one batch of questions.

## Finish (both modes)

1. **Read the results** of each item:
   - **`applied`:** done.
   - **`closed`:** a rejection, or `STALE_PROPOSAL`. Stale means the note changed after the proposal was written (for example your own Notion edit), so the brain did not apply it. Tell the user the current value; the next ingest may propose again.
   - **`recorded`:** decided but not applied (`--record-only`).
   - **`skipped` with `ALREADY_TERMINAL`:** it was already done.
   - **`review_notes` items** also list `notes`, one result each: `reviewed`, `archived` (rejected), `kept_draft` (excluded) and `unchanged` (no longer `draft` when applied: the user changed its Lifecycle in Notion). An applied one lists `changes`, each `applied`, `dropped` (`STALE_PROPOSAL`: its note changed since the row was written, so only that item was closed) or `deferred` (excluded), and `deferred`: the new pending row that holds the excluded items. Name the `kept_draft`, `unchanged`, dropped and deferred items once, under Check.
   - **`failed`:** report the `reason` and `message`. `INVALID_RESULT` means applying it would break a rule, such as a value of the wrong shape. `FIX_UNKNOWN` means a fix named an item the row doesn't have, and `EXCLUDE_UNKNOWN` the same for an "except": re-read What to fix against the proposal. `UNKNOWN_ID` means the proposal or its note is gone.
2. **Rebuild:** run `brain index`, `brain views`, then `brain lint`. If lint reports an error in a file this run changed, stop and report; don't commit.
3. **Commit:** `apply: <n> applied, <n> closed`, listing the proposal titles in the body. If this run does not publish (step 4), push now, per `settings.push` (the brain's AGENTS.md, "Write path").
4. **Publish** *(Notion mode, attended runs only, per `settings.publish`)*. A chat run does not publish: its changes go out with the next Notion-mode run or `brain sync` (spec/cli.md §6, "Apply in chat"). In Notion mode:
   1. Run `brain sync render --changed`, write the pages through the MCP, then `brain sync record`. The steps are the same as in the brain-ingest skill's references/notion.md "Publish": Review rows move to State Applied or Closed, and the changed notes are updated.
   2. Log it with `brain log publish - pages=<n>`; `sync record` itself does not log (§3.9, §5.14.6).
   3. Commit: `publish: apply results`, then push (same rule as step 3).
5. **Report** in three lines (decision 0037):
   ```
   Done: 8 applied · 1 closed (stale) · 12 pages published
   Needs you: 1 failed ("all except k" on Acme launch review: the row has no k) · 2 rows still pending
   Next: say which item you meant, here or in What to fix
   ```
   - **Done:** counts only, and only the ones that aren't zero.
   - **Needs you:** what failed and why in a few words, a stale proposal with the note's current value, what is still pending. `Needs you: nothing` when there is none.
   - **Next:** one action, or one question.

   **Below the three lines, the report grows with what was applied** (decision 0037, amended 2026-10-18), uncapped, one line each:
   - **What changed:** each applied change in words ("Acme budget is now 95000 EUR", "Ivo joins Acme rollout", "6 notes from Acme launch review accepted", "Who owns the mobile app? answered: Carlos Ruiz").
   - **Fixes:** every correction you read and applied, repeated back with its letter and row ("Acme launch review, a: launch set to 2027-03, not 2027-02"; "c: Use Contentful now belongs to Acme app"), so the user can check you read them right.
   - **Check:** each item or proposal closed as stale, with the note's current value; each deferred row, with what it holds; each failure with its reason in a few words; each What to fix the user should look at again; each change proposed from What to fix. Only things the user can act on: a note the render skipped because it has nothing to publish (its type has no database, or nothing changed) is not a finding.

   A run with nothing applied stops at three lines. Never ids, file paths, commands or commit names: the user reads the report to act in Notion or chat, where those mean nothing.

## Don'ts

- **Don't apply anything the user didn't decide in this chat or in Notion.** The user's decision is what makes a change to existing knowledge trusted (decision 0003). An undecided proposal stays open, and the report says how many are waiting.
- **Don't edit notes or proposal files directly** (`sed`, a text editor, a script; U-18) to "help" a proposal along, nor to mark one applied. If a proposal is wrong, the user rejects or fixes it, and `brain sync apply` or `brain apply` writes the result.
- **Don't re-run `apply` after a failure** without changing the input. Apply is atomic per item, and the failed item is unchanged; fix the cause first.
