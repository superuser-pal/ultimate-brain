name: brain-query
description: Answer a question from the user's second brain with citations, such as what was decided and why, who someone is, a date, budget, owner or other key fact, what changed and when. Works from the brain repo or any repo linked to it with `brain link`. Read-only, except its report mode, which writes a report, refreshes it in place and publishes it to the Inbox. Use when the user asks "what did we decide about…", "why did we…", "who is…", "when is the launch…", "what do we know about…", "report on…", "where do we stand with…", "refresh the Acme report", when an Ask row is waiting in the Inbox, a Report row has Refresh asked ticked or a What to fix, or when the repo's "Ultimate Brain" block says to consult the brain before a decision.

# Answer from the brain

Find the notes that answer the question, read them, and answer briefly, citing the notes. **Read-only:** never write to the brain from this skill, except a report in report mode and the log line each answer or report adds (below). If the user wants an answer saved as knowledge, that is a separate step (an ingest or a proposal), done only when they ask.

## Where the brain is

If `brain` is not found (`command not found`), install it with `npm install -g ultimate-brain`, then retry.

- **In the brain repo:** run `brain <command> --brain . --json`.
- **In a linked repo** (it has a `.brain` file and an "Ultimate Brain" block in AGENTS.md): run `brain <command> --json` without `--brain`. The CLI finds the brain through `BRAIN_DIR` or `~/.config/ultimate-brain/config.json`, and reads `.brain` in the current folder to favour that repo's project.
- **If the CLI exits 3** (`BRAIN_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `BRAIN_NOT_FOUND`), tell the user the brain isn't configured on this machine and stop. Don't search the disk for it.

## Procedure

1. **Search.** Run `brain query --candidates "<the question, in the user's words>" --json`.
   - **Search a name as the user wrote it** (a person, client, project) before answering from memory, even when you think you know who they mean: the brain may hold that spelling with other facts, or a person you've never heard of with the same first name.
   - Add `--types decision` (or `person`, `project`, `question`, …) when the question is clearly about one kind of note.
   - Read each candidate's `title`, `summary`, `assessment`, `lifecycle` and `snippets`. **Usually this is enough to choose what to open.**
   - **Search matches whole words from their start.** If the top candidates miss, search again with abbreviations expanded or reversed ("PM" ↔ "product manager", "CMS" ↔ "content management"), with a person's other names, or with the client's name.

2. **Read** the full text of the few notes that answer it, usually 1–5. Follow the links the question needs:
   - **A decision:** read its `## Decision` and `## Context`. For "why", also open the meeting in `decided_in`, and if the reason isn't there, the meeting's source snapshot (`sources/notion/…`), which holds the minutes verbatim.
   - **A `superseded` decision, or a note with a `superseded_by` relation:** follow it to the current note. Answer with the current one, and mention the old one as history.
   - **A fact** (date, budget, role, owner): read the note's `facts` for the current value, and its `timeline` for when it changed and from which meeting.
   - **A person:** their note's `facts.role` (current) and `org`, and the meetings that list them in `attendees`.
   - **Status, priority or progress:** these live in Notion. Use `notion_fields` and say "as of <`notion_fields.as_of` date>".

3. **If nothing fits:** before saying the brain has nothing, retry with other words (a person's alias, the client's name, a synonym), and grep the brain's note folders for the key term (AGENTS.md rule 2: search before claiming absence). If there is still nothing, say so, and say what you searched.

4. **Answer.** Lead with the answer in one to three sentences, then the evidence.
   - **Cite every claim** with the note path, and with the meeting and date for decisions and facts: "Decided at the Acme sync on 2026-12-03 ([knowledge/decisions/2026-12-03-use-supabase-for-auth.md](…))". Use links relative to where you are, or plain paths.
   - **Label trust**, from the frontmatter and markers:
     - `accepted`: state it plainly.
     - `provisional`: "tentatively", "mentioned once, not confirmed".
     - `contested`: give both values and their sources; don't pick one.
     - `superseded`: "was X until <date>, replaced by Y".
     - Lifecycle `draft`: the user hasn't reviewed this note yet. Say so if the answer rests on it.
     - Lifecycle `disputed`: the user marked it wrong. Say so, and don't rely on it.
     - A sentence ending `^[inferred]`: say it is the brain's inference, not something said in the meeting.
     - `^[ambiguous]`: the sources were unclear.
   - **Separate what the brain knows from your own reasoning.** If you add advice, mark it as yours.

5. **Log it,** from the brain repo only: `brain log query - notes_read=<n> seconds=<s>`, where `n` is the number of notes whose full text you read and `s` the seconds from the question to the answer (decision 0045). The log is the brain's own record; it needs no commit of its own and goes in with the next one. In a linked repo, skip this step.

## Report mode (decision 0043)

**Reports are derived, never evidence** (decisions 0043, 0054, 0057): a report's text, accepted refresh included, is never a source for a new note, fact or proposal; if a report says something the notes don't, the report is wrong or the notes are missing something, and you say which. A report is not a proposal target either: knowledge only the brain has that a refresh left out is named to the user, not proposed. A refresh waits while the report's Notion page holds a proposed refresh, an unaccepted edit or accepted text not yet imported (the plan marks its `refresh_requests` item `wording_blocked`): say "resolve the text in Notion first" and leave its Refresh asked box ticked.

A report gathers everything the brain knows about one subject, as of today: "report on the Acme launch", "where do we stand with Acme?", or an **Ask** row in the Inbox (the catch-up hands you its page id, its question and its Project or Area). It runs only in the brain repo. The Ask and Report rows are the **Reports** module (decision 0048, off by default): with it off, a report asked in chat is still written and answered in chat, but it gets no Report row, and render leaves it out (`MODULE_OFF`); say "turn on reports" to have it in Notion.

0. **New or refresh?** A report is kept up to date in place, one per subject (decision 0045). Refresh an existing report when the request names it: its Report row has **Refresh asked** ticked by hand (the Refresh report button no longer ticks it, 0054) (the catch-up hands you `refresh_requests`), or the user says "refresh the Acme report". Otherwise write a new one: an Ask row is always a new report (decision 0048). Never guess that two questions are the same subject.
1. **Gather.** `brain query --candidates "<the subject>" --limit 50`, then again with the project's and client's names and the people's names. Read the project or area note, its Brief, and every decision, question, meeting and source that is about the subject. Unlike an answer, a report reads widely: everything that bears on the subject, `draft` notes included.
2. **Write the body:** exactly these six sections, in this order, with nothing before the first (spec/schema.md §16.4):
   1. `## Where it stands`: 3 to 5 lines, as of today.
   2. `## Timeline`: one bullet per dated event, oldest first: `- 2026-12-03 · Supabase chosen for auth ([Use Supabase for auth](../knowledge/decisions/2026-12-03-use-supabase-for-auth.md))`.
   3. `## Decisions in force`: current decisions only; a superseded one appears in the timeline, never here.
   4. `## Open questions and risks`.
   5. `## People involved`, each with their role.
   6. `## Gaps`: what the brain doesn't know ("no development update since August", "no budget figure").

   A section with nothing says `- None`. **Every line that rests on a `draft` note ends with ` *(not reviewed)*`:** a line whose linked note is still `draft`, even when a proposal about it was approved. A proposal still pending isn't in the brain yet: name it under Gaps ("waiting for your review: …"). Links are relative to `reports/` (`../knowledge/…`, `../projects/…`). Trust labels as in step 4 of the Procedure above; copy figures and dates as the notes state them.
3. **Store it:** `brain report new --input <file>` with `{ "title": "<subject>: where we stand", "question": "<the question as asked>", "projects": ["prj-…"], "area": "area-…", "asked_in": "<the Ask row's page id, only for an Ask row>", "body": "…" }`, with note ids for `projects` and `area`, both left out when the subject has neither (an Ask row with no Project or Area that names none). The CLI checks the sections and links and writes `reports/<date>-<slug>.md`. Commit in step 4: `report: <title>`.
   **A refresh** gathers and writes the whole body again, as of today, and passes `{ "refresh": "<the report's vw- id>", "body": "…" }`, plus `asked_in` when an Ask row asked for it; `title`, `projects` and `area` only when they changed. The CLI rewrites the same file (path, id, `question` and Notion row stay) with a new `generated_at`, and logs `report-refresh` itself; Git keeps the earlier version. Commit in step 4: `report: refresh <title>`.
4. **Log and commit:** `brain log report <vw-id> notes_read=<n> seconds=<s>` (the knowledge notes, meetings and sources whose full text you read, and the seconds the report took; decision 0045), then commit the report and the log together.
5. **Publish** *(Notion, per `settings.publish`)*: `brain sync render --changed`, write the Report row (its body is the report: the brain-ingest skill's references/notion.md, "Inbox bodies"; a refresh is an `update` that replaces the body and clears Refresh asked), then set the Ask row's Brain Status to Done through the MCP, then `brain sync record`, and commit `publish: report <title>`. In a catch-up, the run's one publish does this.
6. **Answer in chat** with the "Where it stands" lines and the Gaps, and the link to the Report row when published.

**What to fix on a report** (decision 0045). The user writes what the report gets wrong on its Report row ("Lucía left Acme in June"); the catch-up hands you `report_fixes`. The error lives in the notes, not in the report, so never edit the report's text to match:
1. Find the notes the line rests on, and write the correction as proposals (brain-ingest references/cli-inputs.md §3): an `update_fact`, an `add_to_note`, a `supersede` …, with `why` = the user's text and `source` = the notes' own source (the meeting or `src-` id the wrong claim came from). When the text needs no change to the notes (the report misread a note that is right), write none and say why in the report.
2. Record it: `brain report fix <vw-id> --text "<What to fix, as written>" --proposals <prp-id>,<prp-id>` (empty `--proposals ""` when none). The next publish clears What to fix on the row.
3. Once every proposal it listed is applied, rejected or closed, refresh the report (above); an approved or fixed one that was only recorded (`--record-only`) still waits. A catch-up checks this each run: a report whose last `fixes` entry lists only such proposals, and wasn't refreshed since, is refreshed.

**A report is never knowledge.** It is never ingested and never cited as a source, and it creates no proposal of its own: if the brain learned from its own summaries, its mistakes would become knowledge. Corrections go to the notes, as above.

## Example (synthetic Acme brain)

**Question:** *"What did we decide about auth with Acme, and why?"*

`brain query --candidates` returns the old Firebase decision first (score 16, `superseded`) and the Supabase decision second (15, `accepted`). The skill follows the supersession and answers with the current decision:

> Acme uses **Supabase for auth**, decided at the Acme sync on 2026-12-03 (knowledge/decisions/2026-12-03-use-supabase-for-auth.md). It replaced the earlier choice of Firebase, made at the kickoff on 2026-10-01 (knowledge/decisions/2026-10-01-use-firebase-for-auth.md, now superseded).
>
> **Why:** the minutes record the switch but not the reason. The brain's note suggests Firebase pricing changed and the team already used Supabase for the database, but that is marked as an inference, not something said in the meeting. The decision note is still a draft you haven't reviewed.

## Don'ts

- **Don't answer from `index.md` or the project views alone.** They're for navigation; cite the canonical note they point to (AGENTS.md rule 8).
- **Don't present a superseded or contested value as current.** The user acts on what you call current. Give the current value, and name the old one as history or both disputed values as contested.
- **Don't read the whole brain.** It fills your context and buries the notes that answer. Search, then open a few notes; open more only when the ones you read point to them.
- **Don't edit anything,** including a "fix" you notice: answering is read-only (AGENTS.md rule 9), so a question never changes what the brain holds. Report it instead; the user can change it through a proposal or in Notion.
